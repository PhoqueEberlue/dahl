Distributed, Arbitrary and Heterogeneous Learning

## Goals

Providing a Distributed Learning runtime, that can run on heterogenous platforms (a myriad of different machines with multiples CPU and/or GPU), and with arbitrary execution order of the operations.

This will let us room to develop energy-aware load balancing algorithms.


## Architectures

Under the hood, [StarPU](https://starpu.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) is used to support heterogenous computing at a single machine level.
